          I am a driven and fast learning software engineer looking for an
          exciting and challenging role to utilize my skills. <br />I recently
          graduated with honors from the MeGo program at Ort College. <br />I
          led an infrastructure team to build a task management web application
          using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. I designed the database
          schema, built the React frontend, and developed an API with
          authentication. <br />I created a tic-tac-toe game in Python where the
          computer learns from my movements. <br />I have excellent
          interpersonal skills such as working effectively in teams, clear
          communication and reliable delivery. <br />I am ambitious and excited
          to face new professional challenges. <br />
          My portfolio and GitHub provide code samples and examples of my work.
