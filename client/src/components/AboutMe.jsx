        <p>
          I am a driven and quick-learning software technician seeking an
          exciting and challenging role to utilize my skills. I recently
          graduated with honors from the MeGo program at Ort College, where I
          honed skills in various programming languages like Python, C#, SQL,
          and JavaScript.
          <br />
          Through MeGo, I led an infrastructure team to build a task management
          web application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. We
          designed the database schema in MongoDB, built a React frontend, and
          developed an API with authentication. <br />I also created a
          tic-tac-toe game in Python where the computer learns from user moves,
          and other projects. <br />
          Beyond coding, I have great interpersonal abilities like working
          effectively on teams, communicating clearly, and delivering reliably
          on deadlines. I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge
          and experience. Whether tackling simple scripts or complex systems, I
          approach problems methodically and creatively. <br />I am an
          ambitious, quick learner excited to take on new professional
          challenges. Please view my portfolio and GitHub for code samples and
          examples of my work.
